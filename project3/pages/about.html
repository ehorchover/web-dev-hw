Experiencing the world with all five senses, then trying to capture moments via methods like video recodring, audio recording, or my personal favorite- photography is special. Trying new experiences and living life fully is the goal and this blog is to help capture/share/inspire and more.</p></div></div><br>

    <div class="text-element"> <p>I recently transferred to a new University out of state. In order to learn more about the beautiful state I now live in, I try to explore all types of things to do or see near and far. Sometimes, exploring pays off and I find the best coffee shop in town or figure out which areas of town to avoid. All in all, this blog combines passion for photography with tips and my take on experiences going through life.</p></div></div><br>
