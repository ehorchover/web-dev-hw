# Project 4- RWD

##Thoughts/Experiences in Project 4
- This has been a different but fun page. Mainly, I think this is because I have learned a lot from Project 3, so I was a bit more prepared.

- In the last project, I realized that having a dark themed page gets old fast and had fun trying a different style and kept it fairly simple.

- As simple as it was, I am having some trouble with getting the correct sizing and placement on the images. Also, the paragraph boxes have been coming out all wrong! Still in the working process, trying to smooth out these little issues to see what else needs to be done.
