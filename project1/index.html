      <h2>By Erin Hanson</h2>
      <p> "There is a fable in the forest
        Whispered by the branches, as they blow.
        A tale about the truth of leaving
        Things that no longer help you grow.
        For on the surface it looks simple,
        Like you only need lace your boots,
        But there is nothing quite as painful
        As untangling your roots.
        And proof is found in tree stumps
        Of the price some pay to flee,
        That they would cut their lives in half
        To cut the time before they're free.
        Yet from the little left behind
        Life has been known to grow again,
        For unless you take your roots
        A part of you will still remain”.   <br />
