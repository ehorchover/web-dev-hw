      <h2>By Erin Hanson</h2>
      <p> Why do we look to someone else,
To show us how we can be more?
For here is where the line 
Between our can and can't gets tough,
Just the point at which we all must learn
That we are already enough,
That since we cannot choose the home,
Our only soul was born into,
We should rearrange its rooms
But learn to love its window's view.”  <br />
