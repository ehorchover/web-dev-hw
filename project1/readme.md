## **Hello, Intro to Web-Dev. What's New?**

 I believe it is safe to say that there are many beginners in this class, all in the same boat. After reading comments from the first Topic, I think it is safe to say that this is in fact, a tough class. So far, I have found that watching the videos and following instructions closely are helpful. This is still all overwhelming and interesting that I am excited to challenege myself with something unfamiliar!

 The videos I am referring to are linked here: https://vimeo.com/mediaedonline
