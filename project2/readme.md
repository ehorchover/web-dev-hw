## Report on: "Instructable"- How to Make Cinnamon Rolls
*  This project is going slightly smoother than the first one, now I feel as though I am really beginning to understand Atom and GitHub. That being said, I am still having to go back and forth from the reading to Atom to make sure I am using the correct Semantics and Structural Markups. To make things a little easier for myself, I created a list as I reading the chapters in Duckett. OK... truth is I'm still not sure what I'm doing and I'm trying to understand all this without getting too overwhelmed.
*  I was going to add a few images, yet I ran into some trouble. Reading ahead in Duckett, I thought I was on the right track but only one of my images was properly displayed on the website. After an hour trying to figure out what I did or didn't do wrong, I decided that I wasn't going to get ahead of myself and scratched the image idea altogether. I also am having trouble with fonts/colors.

Pt.2
* Thank you Justine for your help in the computer lab yesterday! That was the direction I needed to get a handle on this table and form stuff.
* Otherwise this second part of the instructable was getting the best of me and felt like I was hitting a wall. I think I start to understand a concept until I begin typing and stumble around having issues and realizing I do not understand as much as I originally thought. With Justine's help, I got everything figured out! The best part was finally getting my images into the instructable in a semi-decent fashion.
* Once I got the hang of the table and form html, I am pretty proud of how it all turned out! Happy Coding indeed :) The big thing I want to work on is styling. I still need to work on background, colors, text style and such because aesthetically, I am not liking my websites.
