## Report on: "Instructable"- How to Make Cinnamon Rolls
*  This project is going slightly smoother than the first one, now I feel as though I am really beginning to understand Atom and GitHub. That being said, I am still having to go back and forth from the reading to Atom to make sure I am using the correct Semantics and Structural Markups. To make things a little easier for myself, I created a list as I reading the chapters in Duckett. OK... truth is I'm still not sure what I'm doing and I'm trying to understand all this without getting too overwhelmed. 
*  I was going to add a few images, yet I ran into some trouble. Reading ahead in Duckett, I thought I was on the right track but only one of my images was properly displayed on the website. After an hour trying to figure out what I did or didn't do wrong, I decided that I wasn't going to get ahead of myself and scratched the image idea altogether. I also am having trouble with fonts/colors.

### Key Structural and Semantic Markup text to remember in HTML*:
*Structural Markup*: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
  1. <h1>Heading 1</h1> *layers continue until, <h6>Heading 6</h6>
  2. <p>To create a paragraph(s), need open tag with "p" and finish with closing tag "/p". </p>
  3. Make characters **bold**, enclose with open "b" and closing "/b" tags.
  4. *Italic* characters, enclose with open "i" and closing "/i" tags.
  5. Make characters <sup>superscript</sup>, enclose with open "sup" and close with "/sup" tag.
  6. Make characters <sub>subscript</sub>, enclose with open "sub" and close with "sub" tag.
  7. White Space Collapsing <dfn>when the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too.</dfn>
  8. To add **line break** in middle of paragraph, use line break tag-"br /".
  9. To create a break using a horizontal line, add horizontal rule- "hr /" tag.

  *Semantic Markup*: provides extra info; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

  10. To indicate content has **strong importance**, enclose with open "strong" and close "/strong" element. Will make content bold.
  11. To **emphasis content**, enclose with open "em" and close "/em" element. Will italicize content.
  12. Long quotes that take up an entire paragraph use **"blockquote" element**(open) and close "/blockquote" inside the paragraph tag.
  13. Shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph, use **"q" element**(open) and close "/q".
  14. Abbreviation or an acronym, use the "abbr" element. A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term (ex: 'abbr title="..."').
  15. Reference a piece of work with **cite element**, enclose with open "cite" and close with "/cite" element.
  16. First time you explain new terminology, use open and close **"dfn" element**.
  17. To show that content has been **inserted** into a document, use open "ins" and closed "/ins" element.
  18. To show **deleted** content, use open "del" and closed "/del" element.
  19. To indicate something is no longer accurate or relevant (but should not be deleted), use open "s" and close "/s" element.
  20. Unordered lists, created with open "ul" and closed "/ul" element. Each item in the list is in between an open "li" and closed "/li" tag.
  21. Definition list is created with open "dl" element and usually will see pairs of "dt" (definition term) and "dd"(contains the definition) elements.
